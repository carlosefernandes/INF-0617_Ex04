# INF-0617: Ex04, Vocaulary Complexity
## Students: Carlos Eduardo Fernandes and Yakov Nae 

In this exercise we will be working with the Gutenberg library that contains 595 files, hostinga total space of 427MB. Our goal is to determine who is the most complex author. In other words, we the portion of exotic words evry author is using and select the one with the highest relation between exotic and regular words.

### Running instructions:
This zip file contains a run.sh file with the following two fields:

	#INITIALIZATION
	INPUT_FOLDER="/tmp/data/votacao2014/"
	WORK_FOLDER="/tmp/data/INF-0617_Ex03"
	
In order to run our code, please modify these two reference accordingly. The `INPUT_FOLDER` variable is the foder where the `votacao_secao_2014_SP.txt` file is at within the container. The `WORK_FOLDER` variable is where our code is at. Also, output files will be writen to this folder. After modifing these variables, please execute `$ ./run.sh`.

### Mapper strategy
The input file contain election records comma separated where the general elections (12ve entry iquals to 3) is of following form:

	"27/10/2014";"17:38:00";"2014";"1";"ELEIÇÕES GERAIS 2014";"SP";"SP";"63134";"CARAPICUÍBA";"388";"197";"3";"GOVERNADOR";"95";"40"
	"27/10/2014";"17:38:00";"2014";"1";"ELEIÇÕES GERAIS 2014";"SP";"SP";"63134";"CARAPICUÍBA";"388";"197";"3";"GOVERNADOR";"96";"35"

The 14th entry in each line reffers to the voted party and the 15th is the number of votes. Our mapper maps the input file into `Map(Key,Value)` where the key is the party number and the value is the number of votes.
 
### Reducer strategy
Our reducer strategy is to combine all keys (party number) by summing their values (number of votes). Shuffeling would try to direct the same key to the same reducer worker. However, even if two workers were summing the same key, they can later be reduced by this same strategy.

### Results:
Here we show the finnel results of our program. Remembering that the 95 party code was converted to blank vote and 96 as Null vote. There were no 97 ("Voto Anulado e Apurado em Separado") party codes in the database:

	13 - 3888584	
	15 - 4594708	
	21 - 12958	
	28 - 22822	
	29 - 11118	
	31 - 132042	
	43 - 260696	
	45 - 12230807	
	50 - 187487	
	Voto Branco - 2020613	
	Voto Nulo - 2374946
